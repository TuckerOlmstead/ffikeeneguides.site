A simple static html/css informational website for a local hotel.

This is an informational website designed for a local hotel to provide local information to guest such as maps, cycling trails, parking directions. It is linked to a QR code for guest to scan at check-in. It started as a single page site with only a parking map but I felt needed to be expanded. I am not compensated for this just felt it would make a nicer experience for travellers. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript edited in VS Code.
